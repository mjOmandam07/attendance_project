# CSC 161 Attendance System
Managing in a clean and orderly fashion in any department is an important
part of dealing with day-to-day life. However just like with most things,
it would be a daunting task to do it every single day which may result to
inefficiency. Especially in hectic environments such as schools where everything must be recorded.

 The system, student attendance management system, would aid to eliminate the inefficiencies brought by human error which
would make a part of the recording system on a classroom less stressful. The
system which is implemented into an application is a simple attendance management system focused on applying the features of the security system.

DISCLAIMER: Front-end is not polished due to time constraint, the developers decided to focus on its security system
